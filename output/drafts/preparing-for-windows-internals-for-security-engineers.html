                <p>In mid of May I have the honor to participate in the Windows Internals 4-day training at OffensiveCon. Since I want to come prepared there are some things I will do beforehand.</p>
<h2>General Preperation</h2>
<p>I will go with a split process of reading the new Windows Internals Books and watching the videos on Plural Sight to Windows 11 from Pavel Yosifovich (payed content). They both have the same topic, the books have more depth, but are somewhat harder and more time consuming to go through.</p>
<p>The videos are very good, but sometimes lack on a certain topic. Everytime one option gets boring or I find myself not progressing I switch to the other method.</p>
<h2>Specific Preperation</h2>
<p>After that I go trough the description of the training and on every buzzword I don't know of, I will research about the contents.</p>
<p>The buzzwords per OS version are:</p>
<p>Windows 11:
- GRU bootkits 
- PLA software supply chain implants
- NSA Backdoors
- Kernel Data Protection (KDP)
- eXtended Control Flow Guard (XFG)
- Kernel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (KCET)
- System Guard Runtime Assertions
- Secure Launch framework (Intel TXT and AMD SKINIT for new DRTM-based attestation)
Windows 10:
- Virtual Trust Levels (VTL)
- Virtualization Based Security (VBS)
- Hyper Visor Code Integrity (HVCI)
- Kernel Control Flow Guard (KCFG)
- Software Guard Extensions (SGX)
Windows 8.1:
- Protected Process Light
- Custome Code Signing Policies
Windows 8:
- AppContainer
- Secure Boot
-
Windows 7:
- Object Manager data structures</p>
<h3>Resources to the Topics</h3>
<p><span style="color:blue">GRU Rootkits</span> seems to be made up or at least I can't find anything about it. I guess GRU is something russian... or the (good) villain from minions. Anyway, its a rootkit and therefore just a kernel malware.</p>
<p>Sadly again, no idea what PLA stands for. But its about supply chain attacks. I don't see how preparation for that would help me for the course.</p>
<p>NSA Backdoors is at least something known. So the text goes on to describe the above three as kernel and firmware malware.</p>
<p>My understanding is its about modified kernels or drivers.
Therefore preparing would be to learn about offensive driver development (they run in the kernel). I took the course from here:
https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/offensive-driver-development</p>
<p>Also there is a from Pavel about Windows Kernel Programming, which I will go through.</p>
<p>Next we have <span style="color:blue">Kernel Data Protection (KDP)</span>.</p>
