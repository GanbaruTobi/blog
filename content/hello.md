Hello ppl,

this will be my blog, where I write about binary exploitation.
I will focus on Windows mostly, at least till end of 2025.

Currently I work on finishing Offensive Security's OSED Course (EXP-301) and
will have the Windows Internals Training at OffensiveCon in the mid of May.

I will create a companion GitHub repository where I will store all the tools and knowledge related to the latest techniques I learn and tools I use.

Else feel free to contact me, to join forces in CTF's or in binary pwning or when u have tips for me =)

Happy Hacking
